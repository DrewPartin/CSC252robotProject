Miao, I created the header file with all the functions we are supposed to have and I made the constructor for generating a Robot object. 
Can you add the code for the functions listed in the header file plz? I will put the main() in there when youre done. Thanks man.

Too bad we couldnt get the GitHub part to work, but I went ahead and took your code and copied it in. I finished the main() and it runs great. I'll email you a copy unless you want to try and clone this one. Its finished. Thanks man.
